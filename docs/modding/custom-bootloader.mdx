# Custom bootloader (ChouChou)
:::warning
Make sure you have the [bootloader unlocked](../dev/bootloader.md) or you will get [soft brick](https://penangf.fuckyoumoto.xyz/docs/info/softbrick)!
:::

:::info
Thanks to [Roger Ortiz](https://github.com/R0rt1z2) for developing the payload for our bootloader!
:::

The custom bootloader protects the device from Hard Brick by preventing critical operations such as flashing the preloader and locking the bootloader without restoring the original firmware.

In addition, it extends the functionality by adding new options for customizing and managing the system.

It was originally developed for [penangf (Moto G13/G23)](https://penangf.fuckyoumoto.xyz/docs/modding/custom-bootloader), but was ported for fogorow keeping all functionality and adding new functionality specific to our device.

## Features
- Blocks ```fastboot flash preloader```
- Removes orange state
- Spoofes verified state to green
- Block ```fastboot flashing lock```
- Adds ```fastboot oem help```
- Adds ```fastboot oem hexdump```
### Specific features, only for our device
- The bootloader auto-lock security feature has been removed
- Preventing factory mode
- Fuse check
- Added ability to flash any partition

## Install
:::warning
Initial installation requires an engineering DA (Use AMT Tool for example).

To upgrade or rollback to another version of ChouChou you can use mtkclient or fastboot

### Prebuild images

export const grouped = images.reduce((acc, item) => {
    if (!acc[item.payload_version]) {
        acc[item.payload_version] = [];
    }
    acc[item.payload_version].push(item);
    return acc;
}, {});

{Object.keys(grouped).map(payload_version => (
<details key={payload_version} className="custom-details">
<summary>ChouChou v{payload_version}</summary>
<ul>
{grouped[payload_version].map(item => (
<a href={item.url}><li key={item.firmware_version}>{item.firmware_version}</li></a>
))}
</ul>
</details>
))}

### Manually build
1. Download your current firmware archive from [lolinet](https://mirrors.lolinet.com/firmware/lenomola/2024/fogorow/official/)
2. Clone repository [chouchou](https://github.com/R0rt1z2/chouchou/tree/fogorow) **(branch fogorow)**
3. Transfer the ```lk.img``` file from the firmware archive to the directory ```chouchou```
4. Install dependencies
     ```shell
     $ sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-newlib arm-none-eabi-gcc
     ```
5. Build payload
     ```shell
     $ cd payload; make; cd ..
     ```
6. Patch stock lk
     ```shell
     $ python3 patch_lk.py lk.img payload/build/payload.bin
